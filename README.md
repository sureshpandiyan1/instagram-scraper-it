## How Instagram-scraper-it works ?

![workflow-i-s-t](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112636345/188807597-cae1d087-03f1-4f44-9f64-d310c8d75bda.jpg)


## How to run? 

## STEP 1:
   - just open auth.py & place your username and password
   - run the Ibot.py to get your current session id
    
    `python Ibot.py`

## STEP 2:
   - once you get a session id, run the main file and follow the instructions
    
    `python main.py`
   

## About Session ID activity:
- it will stay for more than 5 days for active use, 
      after some days session id will be re-generated by Instagram.
      so, you need to get a new session id


## Highlight about instagram-scraper-it:
- no need to use sign-in details
- user-friendly
- load faster
- builtin live status for Instagram-scrap-it

## If you get an Error like this:

| **ERROR**                         | **SOLUTION**                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **check your point or challenge** | just go to your Instagram profile and verify the mobile number                        |
| **connection error**              | you did not turn on your internet connection                                              | 
| **JSON decode error**             | maybe the session id is expired, simply go to your Instagram id and pick up a new session id |
| **too many requests**             | just try after a few mins or after some hours                                           |


## COMMON - you need to be aware of Instagram [my opinion]
     - if your main profile URL gets blocked, just leave it for 24 or 48 hours
     - suppose you make 20 requests, just give some hours gaps
     - inbox, main page - don't get blocked 
     - don't ever give plenty of requests like 100, Instagram thinks you like a spam bot
     - they collect a device id and Infos to figure out what we're doing all the time
     - Instagram is tricky API - give false information too -  ex: users: [], status: 'ok'
